Download the jar file for your server software and place it in the folder that your server uses for plugins.

1. Download the jar file for LWC that is for your server software
2. Copy it to the plugins/mods folder for your server (see below)
3. Start or restart your server. LWC will download everything it needs and then you can use it!

If you're unsure where to put the LWC jar file, here's a table:


<div align="center">
    <table class="table docutils">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Server</th>
                <th>Plugin Folder</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Bukkit</th>
                <td>plugins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Canary</th>
                <td>plugins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Granite</th>
                <td>plugins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Forge</th>
                <td>mods</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Sponge</th>
                <td>mods</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
