Allows you to protect a block.

### Usages

##### Private protection

    /lwc protect

Only you can access the protection. You can add others to the protection afterwards.

##### Public protection

    /lwc protect anyone

Anyone can access the protection. The best use for this is for making it so that no one can protect the block using LWC.

##### Password protection

    /lwc protect password <password>

Everyone (including yourself) must enter the password to the protection before they can use it or modify it. The password needs to only be entered once per login.
