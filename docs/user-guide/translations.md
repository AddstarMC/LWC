If LWC is translated in the language a player's client is set to, LWC will automatically send them messages in that language. LWC no longer uses a global language setting for every player. This makes translations much more useful because anyone can benefit from them without the server having to choose a specific language to use.

LWC is using CrowdIn to allow translators to participate in translating LWC. This is what Mojang themselves are using for Minecraft.
