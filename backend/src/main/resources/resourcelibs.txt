# These files are required to get LWC past the bare minimum startup stage
# They will be downloaded (if needed) from the LWC server.
# The rest of the library files will download from the configured location (see resources.yml)
# The class name is the class that is checked before the library is downloaded. If the class already
# exists in the class loader then the file will not be downloaded and loaded.
