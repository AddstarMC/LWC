# Canary

The only major difference when using Canary is permissions. There are two main permissions in LWC for Canary:

* `/lwc` Access to normal protection commands. This is generally permissions lwc.?? when compared to a YAML based Permissions system such as that in Bukkit.
* `/lwcadmin` Access to all administrative features of LWC. This **allows you to do bad things** so be weary if you do give this out. When compared to YAML based Permissions systems this is the equivalent to `lwc.admin`
