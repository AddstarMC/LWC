# Forge

LWC for Forge supports **SMP, SSP, and LAN**. For SSP and LAN it acts as a protection plugin (only useful for SSP if you plan to open up to LAN). The client mod **is not** required. At the moment the client mod only gives you LWC in SSP / LAN.

## Compatibility with other mods

Nothing here yet. Know a mod LWC is compatible with? Incompatible with? Hit me up!
